The aim of the project is to modify and optimize the existing PathFinding.js library as a part of Mars Colonization Program, Microsoft Engage 2020. The project is a browser based web application to help the Mars Curiosity Rover find the shortest path to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the way. It also includes finding the most optimal path covering multiple destinations on the way and a fun feature of race between rovers. Some of the other key features are dynamic node size and dynamic statistics.
